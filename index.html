                It started off as a common idea: what if people could watch shows in the palms of their hands? And as such, TECHIX was born. Klair was a huge fan of shows and wanted a way to watch it on a portable dev ice. She also had a degree in electronics and design. 
                Alec, on the other hands, was a tech-savvy person who happens to also share the same interest as Klair. He has a degree in computer science and software engineering. 
                Together, they built TECHIX.</p>
